## Change-Point Paris-Saclay conference (January 2023)

Co-organizer with [Charles Truong](https://charles.doffy.net)

The Paris-Saclay Change-Point workshop is a **2-day meeting** (January 16th and 17th 2023) dedicated to **theoretical and applied methods for solving change-point detection problems**. The primary goal of the workshop consists in fostering new interactions within the European community of change-point researchers. This event is **free of charge** (no registration fee) and open to anyone willing to contribute to the development of the field (M2 students, PhD, young and senior researchers).

## Current work

Assistant Professor in statistics *since September 2019* at the University of Evry (near Paris) in the laboratory [LaMME](http://www.math-evry.cnrs.fr/doku.php). My current research is about *changepoint detection* using pruned dynamic programming algorithm with a focus on the multivariate framework and application to genomics.


As an Applied Mathematician, I like to work at the interface of different fields. My current and past interests are 

**Statistics** : Change-point detection (by dynamic programming)

**Optimization** : Convex optimization, Computational geometry, Quadratic and linear programming.

**Numercial analysis** : Quasi-Newton algorithm

**Package development** : gfpop, dust (see github)

In particular, problems involving *optimization tools* are among my favorites..
