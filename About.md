## Co-organizer of the Change-Point Paris-Saclay conference (January 2023)

The Paris-Saclay Change-Point workshop is a **2-day meeting** (January 16th and 17th 2023) dedicated to **theoretical and applied methods for solving change-point detection problems**. The primary goal of the workshop consists in fostering new interactions within the European community of change-point researchers. This event is **free of charge** (no registration fee) and open to anyone willing to contribute to the development of the field (M2 students, PhD, young and senior researchers).

## Current work

Assistant Professor in statistics *since September 2019* at the University of Evry (near Paris) in the laboratory [LaMME](http://www.math-evry.cnrs.fr/doku.php). My current research is about *changepoint detection* using pruned dynamic programming algorithm with a focus on the multivariate framework and application to genomics.


As an Applied Mathematician, I like to work at the interface of different fields. My current and past interests are 

**Statistics** : Change-point detection, Lasso regularization, Logistic regression.

**Optimization** : Convex optimization, Computational geometry, Quadratic and linear programming.

**Analysis** : PDE, Control theory, Complex analysis, Univalent polynomials.

**Mathematical Physics** : Fluid dynamics, Hele-Shaw problem, Numerical analysis.

In particular, problems involving *optimization* are among my favorites. They are close to application and the guidline principle of my research.
