I particularly enjoy initiating and organizing new events. 

My ultimate goal is **the Math Night-Train Conference**: a two-week conference on a special night train crossing Europe. 
A €1 million initiative to change what a scientific conference can be -- forever.

Here is a list of the conferences and events I have recently organized.


- [Ukrainian Mathematics Days](#umd) (2026)
- [Ukrainian math day](#ukraine) (2025)
- [Impact IA](#impact) (2025-2026)
- [TDA working group](#tda) (2025)
- [Change-Point Paris-Saclay conference (January 2023)](#chpt) (2023)


### <a id="umd"> Ukrainian Mathematics Days (Institut Henri Poincaré 2026)

[website of the conference UMD 2026](https://ukrmathday2026.sciencesconf.org/?lang=en)

We organize a two-day conference called **Ukrainian Mathematics Days 2026**, following the success of the previous (smaller) event. 
Organizing commitee: 

- Anna Bahrii (Evry Paris-Saclay University, LaMME)
- Maryna Kachanovska (POEMS team, Inria)
- Illia Karabash (Universität Bonn)
- Kostyantyn Krutoy (Paris-Cité University, IMJ-PRG)
- Ruben Martos (Sorbonne Université, SAMM lab)
- Vincent Runge (Evry Paris-Saclay University, LaMME)

I delighted to organize in collaboration with 5 colleagues the first conference of Ukrainian mathematics in France.

UMD 2026 is a conference that offers a unique opportunity to exchange ideas and foster collaborations with and within the Ukrainian mathematical community in Europe. It brings together early-career researchers and senior mathematicians, with a particular focus on mentoring younger Ukrainian students based in Europe, particularly in the Paris Region.

The first edition of the conference takes place on the 4th-5th of June 2026 at the Institut Henri Poincaré, Paris, Amphithéâtre Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat.
The theme covered by this edition is broad, reflecting the scientific expertise of Ukrainian mathematics. It has a particular focus on PDEs, SDEs, operator algebras, and machine learning.

We envision this event as the first meeting of a biennial series, where Ukrainian and Western European mathematicians showcase their collaborative work and strengthen the integration of the Ukrainian math community into the European research landscape.



### <a id="ukraine"> Ukrainian Math Day in Evry Paris-Saclay (February 2025)

"Ukrainian Math Day in Évry Paris-Saclay #1" is a special event where Ukrainian mathematicians share their ongoing research in mathematics with a diverse audience.

Hosted at the University of Évry Paris-Saclay, this event brings together mathematicians, researchers, and students — from undergraduate to PhD level — to explore topics in pure and applied mathematics.

Through insightful lectures, engaging discussions, and valuable networking opportunities, the event seeks to promote knowledge exchange and support the Ukrainian mathematical community, which has been dispersed across Europe and beyond due to the ongoing war.

### <a id="impact"> Impact IA for master student (February 2025) #1

Cet événement est conçu pour échanger "au delà des mathématiques" sur les conséquences écologiques, économiques, éthiques ou juridiques de l'utilisation des modèles d'IA.
 
Co-financée par la FMJH et DATAIA, la journée ImpAct s'adresse en priorité aux étudiants de master de Paris-Saclay, plus particulièrement aux étudiants en mathématiques (Data Science, IA...). Un public plus large est bienvenu dans la limite des places disponibles.
L'événément est organisé en collaboration avec Gilles Blanchard (LMO, Paris-Sasclay)

### <a id="chpt"> Change-Point Paris-Saclay conference (January 2023)

Co-organizer with [Charles Truong](https://charles.doffy.net)

The Paris-Saclay Change-Point workshop is a **2-day meeting** (January 16th and 17th 2023) dedicated to **theoretical and applied methods for solving change-point detection problems**. The primary goal of the workshop consists in fostering new interactions within the European community of change-point researchers. This event is **free of charge** (no registration fee) and open to anyone willing to contribute to the development of the field (M2 students, PhD, young and senior researchers).
